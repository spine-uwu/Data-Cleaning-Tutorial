# Data-Cleaning-Tutorial
This is my first data cleaning project. But I did this with the help of YouTube Tutorial. Afterwards I plan to build another project on data cleaning without any help.

In this project I used this sequence to clean up the data:
  1. Removing Duplicates
  2. Standardizing Data
  3. Null/Blank Values
  4. Removing irrelevant columns and rows
